				<p>Hi! My name is Michael Caldwell. My pronouns are He/Him/His. I am a Pursuit fellow with experience in Retail and Customer Service. My journey into software engineering began when I was a young boy wanting to create the games that I loved to play. My skills include problem-solving, creative thinking, and customer service. Given my passion for gaming and storytelling, I want to tell stories that illustrate my communities in the most authentic light possible.</p>
